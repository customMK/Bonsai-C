# Bonsai C4 compact edition

Brought to you by customMK, Bonsai C4 compact edition is the same circuit as the extended edition, with the exception that the board is shorter (to match the ProMicro length) and the on-board FRAM and flash memory are placed on the back of the PCB. This is useful for pre-existing keyboard designs that only have the physical space for a ProMicro, while retaining the full capability of Bonsai C4.
