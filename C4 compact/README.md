# Bonsai C4 compact edition

Brought to you by customMK, Bonsai C4 compact edition is the same circuit as the Bonsai C4 normal/extended edition, with the exception that the PCB is made shorter (to match the ProMicro length) and the on-board FRAM and flash memory are located on the back of the PCB. This is useful for pre-existing keyboard designs that only have the physical space available for a ProMicro (Kyria, Sofle, Lily58, etc.), while retaining the full capability of Bonsai C4 (extended edtion) aside from the extra pins.
